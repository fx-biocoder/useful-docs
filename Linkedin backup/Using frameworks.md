# Should you use frameworks and/or prebuilt engines for your project?

When we start a new project, we often ask ourselves the following question: "What framework could I use for this?". Though frameworks can save you a lot of coding time, they also come with certain disadvantages. So, I wanted to show the pros and cons of frameworks or prebuilt engines for software development.

### What are the advantages of using frameworks and engines?

1. **They save you a lot of time:** these tools come with sets of pre-written code that reduces the time you need to develop a project.
2. **They're (mostly) consistent and reliable:** there is a huge community of developers working with any framework, so you can expect it to be thoroughly tested. It also allows you to find abundant online documentation.
3. **They're easier to maintain and update:** since frameworks and engines follow standard coding practices and are designed in a modular fashion, the maintenance of a project becomes much easier to perform.
4. **They have a large community:** as I said before, there is a huge community of developers working with the same framework, and that allows you to find help relatively quickly in case something is not working as you intend.
5. **Saving money:** Frameworks and engines are usually FOSS, so you can save a lot of money by using frameworks instead of hiring someone who codes a solution from scratch.


### What about the disadvantages?

1. **They're less flexible and customizable:** since you're working with prebuilt software, you are limited to constraints that the creator has already defined.
2. **They have a learning curve:** you will need to spend time learning how to use the framework. Time you will not be able to use for programming.
3. **Security risks:** any utility that is not properly maintained is vulnerable to security threats. Remember Log4Shell?
4. **Dependency issues:** using a framework or engine makes you dependent on it. If you plan to keep using that framework or engine forever, then it's not a problem. But what if you want to migrate the project to a different technology? Well, the banking system has this issue.
5. **Bloat:** Yes, the worst enemy of users and developers alike. These frameworks and engines come with lots of utilities that you will not use for the project, which will cause your project to go slower than it should. This is the main reason I try to avoid using frameworks or engines if I don't see the need.
