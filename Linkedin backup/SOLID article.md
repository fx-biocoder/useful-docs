# SOLID: A Set of Design Principles to Improve your Software

As software developers, I think we all strive to create code that is not only functional, but also maintainable and scalable.
That's where SOLID design principles come in - a set of guidelines that can help us achieve just that. In this article, we will explore the core principles of SOLID and how they can be applied to create software that is easy to understand, modify, and extend. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, understanding SOLID principles can take your coding skills to the next level and make you a better engineer. So, let's dive in.

### First SOLID Principle: Single Responsibility Principle

Software becomes more and more complex with time. And so, it becomes increasingly important to design code that is easy to understand, test and maintain. And that's where the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) comes in - one of the key principles of SOLID design. At its core, SRP states that a class should be responsible for only one thing, and do that thing well.
By adhering to SRP, we can create code that is more modular and easier to modify, since each class has a clear and specific responsibility. This makes it easier to test and debug code, as well as to add new features without inadvertently affecting other parts of the system.
Of course, implementing SRP is easier said than done. It requires careful planning and design, as well as a deep understanding of the requirements of the system.

### Second SOLID Principle: Open/Closed Principle

In the world of sotware development, change is inevitable. Requirements evolve, bugs are found, and new features need to be added. But how can we write code that is flexible enough to accomodate these changes, without breaking existing functionality? This is where the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) comes in.

OCP states that software entities (such as classes, modules or functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. What does that mean? It means that we should design our code in a way that we add new functionality without changing existing code. This can be achieved through the use of abstractions and interfaces, which allow us to define a set of behaviours that can be implemented in various ways, without modifying the original code.

This principle will allow us to add new features without worrying about breaking existing code, and swap out implementations of a behaviour without affecting other parts of the system. Of course, designing code that is both open and closed can be challenging, but it is an essential skill for any software developer.

### Third SOLID Principle: Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that if a program is designed to work with objects of a certain type, it should also be able to work with objects that are derived from that certain type without causing errors or unexpected behaviour. To be more specific - we should be able to replace a parent object with one of its child objects, without affecting the correctness of the program.
To follow this principle, the subclasses must not change the behaviour of the parent class. They can, however, extend or refine that behaviour, which means that any methods or properties present in the base class must also be present in the derived class, carrying the same functionality.
This principle might be a bit of a challenge to apply, since it requires a clear understanding of the behaviour and requirements of the business logic.

### Fourth SOLID Principle: Interface Segregation Principle

Interfaces play a crucial role in defining the behaviour of our code. They allow us to define a set of behaviours that objects must implement, without specifying how those behaviours are implemented. As our systems become larger and more complex, it is essential to ensure that our interfaces are designed in a way that promotes modularity and extensibility.
The Interface Segregation Principle, or ISP, indicates that we should not force classes to depend on interfaces they do not use. Which means we should design our interfaces in a way that each class only depends on the methods that it actually needs. Imagine having a single, big and monolithic interface that is being implemented by several unrelated classes - this is what this principle tries to avoid.
To apply ISP, we can start by creating smaller, more focused interfaces that possess specific behaviours. If needed, we should refactor existing interfaces to separate them into smaller chunks that define different behaviours.

### Fifth SOLID Principle: Dependency Inversion Principle

Last, but not least!
As your codebase gets bigger and bigger, it is easy to get lost in complex dependencies different parts of the code. It can lead to difficulties in maintaining, modifying and testing the code. This is where the Dependency Inversion Principle, or DIP, comes in - you should design your software in a way that promotes the decoupling of different modules, by making high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations or low-level modules.
By doing this, changes on low-level modules will not affect high-level modules. To achieve this we can define interfaces or abstract classes that represent the behaviour our code needs, and then having other classes implementing those interfaces or inheriting from the abstract classes. After that, we make our high-level modules depend on those interfaces or abstractions.
